Layer Channels Panel
====================
There are two modes in the Layer Channels panel: Line Mode and Free Mode. The line mode can directly use the function of the layer channel 
through the selected material node and input channel. Free mode is suitable for more advanced users. It is recommended to use it after you 
are more familiar with ACPainter. You need to connect the material nodes yourself, but the application changes more.
